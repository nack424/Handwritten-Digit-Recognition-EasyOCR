# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-EasyOCR

This repository show how I used EasyOCR to predict number in Super AI Engineer 2021: Handwritten Digit hackatron during 14-16 January 2022.

[Levenshtein Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) are used as an evaluation method during hackatron.

I got 2.82027 Levenshtein Mean in hackatron's test set, showing that we need to insert, delete or change 2.82027 character in average.
